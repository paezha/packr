# packr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of packr is to present a minimal example of package creation in `R`. It uses {usethis} functions to create the package, the license, and README.Rmd file, as well as the documentation and appropriate folders for data. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of packr from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){
    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)
}
remotes::install_github("paezha/packr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the package:
```{r example}
library(packr)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
```{r cars}
summary(energy_and_emissions)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE}
# Simple Scatterplot
attach(energy_and_emissions)
plot(Population, bblpd, 
     main="Scatterplot Example",
     xlab="Population ", 
     ylab="Barrels of oil per day ", 
     pch=19)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

And, you can include equations:
$$
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
$$
